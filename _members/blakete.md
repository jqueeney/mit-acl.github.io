I am a graduate researcher at MIT AeroAstro dedicated to pushing the boundaries of learning-enabled, autonomous cyber-physical systems while ensuring their safe, trustworthy deployment. Although this revolutionary confluence of technologies promises transformative impact in aerospace and beyond, many breakthroughs remain unrealized due to a persistent—and often warranted—trust gap. My work focuses on bridging this gap by developing robust, scalable verification and validation methods. Building on my undergraduate AI research and experience at Boeing Research & Technology, Boeing AI, and DARPA’s Assured Autonomy program, I aim to unify groundbreaking advances in autonomy with the rigorous assurance needed for high-risk, mission-critical domains.
